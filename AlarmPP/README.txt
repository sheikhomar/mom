This is the alarm example from the VDM++ book, John Fitzgerald, Peter
Gorm Larsen, Paul Mukherjee, Nico Plat and Marcel Verhoef. Validated
Designs for Object-oriented Systems, Springer, New York. 2005, ISBN
1-85233-881-4. The example is inspired by a subcomponent of a large
alarm system developed by IFAD A/S. It is modelling the management of
alarms for an industrial plant. The purpose of the model is to clarify
the rules governing the duty roster and calling out of experts to deal
with alarms. A comparable model of this example also exists in VDM-SL.
